# zero-shot
Zero-shot classification of Patient Experience data.

Two working scripts:

- `ht_T_training_Bert.py`- fine-tuning a BERT model
- `hg_zero_shot.py`- Zero-shot classification

Note- these scripts run pretty heavy processes and can take forever. Make sure
to experiment with small samples for the time being, while we explore ways of 
making them more efficient.
