Communication,"Appointment details given over phone - no physical evidence/reminder which could cause problems. Other than that, nothing apparent, thank you. Service on the day excellent, thank you."
Communication,On one occasion I was not made aware that my appointment could not be kept until I arrived at the centre. A phone call would have saved me a 22 mile round trip which would have been costly if I had had to take a taxi.
Environment/ facilities,"The blood pressure monitor and cuff smelt of cigarettes which was quite unpleasant. Also old perfume/aftershave. I don't know if there is any way of removing the smell in between users, but it would be an improvement."
Couldn't be improved,Nothing at present.
Access,Long wait for the appointment.
Dignity,"2 Staff Members I had an issue with in regards to lack of patience with my capabilities, seeming to be interested in moving onto the next job."

Staff,"A lot. Our baby girl was born 6 weeks premature, mid 2019. She had a 8 - 12 month assessment form filled by myself. In [Redacted for data protection], it was given to the home visitor on [Redacted for data protection]. Due to my girl not having stood up supported by that time, and also COVID preventing the home visitor doing a height measurement and head measurement, they told us that they would return in [Redacted for data protection] to check on the gross motor skills and to do a full height measurement etc.  We then had a second visit week commencing [Redacted for data protection], my baby girl was standing up at the sofa on her own and was weighed and measured.  The same home visitor as before then asked if I had filled in the assessment form and I told her we had given it to her on her last visit.  The very next thing she said was the form we were given was incorrect it was for a full term baby and we should have been given a premature baby assessment form, therefore, my baby was on target for her adjusted age and doing fine in all areas and so this second meeting was not required.  How can someone question whether we had filled in a form and then say in the next breath, the form filled in was for full term babies? My assumption here is the form has gone missing!!  I then asked whether there would be any further assessments and she told me no not until the baby is 2 years old.  Fast forward to [Redacted for data protection] - now had another letter requesting a growth review!!! The NHS website states that these weight checks etc should be carried out NO MORE than every 3 months and that once the 1 year assessment is complete the next one is at 2 years old.  We have had 3 in 3 months!!  I point blank refuse to go to this one and will not be going to anymore until my baby is 2 years old, it is taking time out of mine or my husbands work for each one of these assessments, we have now been lied to, more than once. If my baby girl is not on track for her growth why are we not being told at the assessment?  According to her red book, all her measurements are fine or are we being lied to again? If a further assessment is required I want a full reason as to why, I want an explanation on why we haven't been told at past assessments. I also want compensation for loss of earnings for every future assessment before 2 years old, we have to attend whilst in working hours! Get it sorted!"
Care received,Let people get rest properly. Checking every hour and opening doors then relocking them means I haven't have one good night rest since I arrived. The food is not good in my opinion.
Couldn't be improved,In my experience I have nothing but praise.
Couldn't be improved,"Nothing, my nurses are the best."
Environment/ facilities,The only thing I can think of is the commodes could have been a lot smaller as I am very short.  So a different sizes would help to make it more comfortable.
Access,"I am begging for help with my child’s behaviours, and nobody is helping me. I don’t know where to go or who to contact."
Care received,"When you leave... jeez! Like you leave and they say oh we’ve made sure you have this, this and this support. But as soon as you walk out those doors. You have nobody! And then they blame it on you."
Couldn't be improved,No.

Care received,"Ideally a face to face consultation, however at these very difficult times that was impossible."
Communication,"We have struggled getting through on the mobile in the evening. We often try all the way from 6.30 to 7.30, the landline isn't always any better."
Couldn't be improved,Nothing better for me. 
Environment/ facilities,food could be better. Physio could be better would like to know first thing in the morning if getting physio would have like it one time a day not three time week. Would have like physio everyday would more decisions input in care.

Staff,Female staff do not be using their mobiles whilst sat on the ward.  They pay more attention to that that us.
Staff,"Male members of staff have takeaways daily, this isn't fair as I cannot afford takeaways, they can be very selfish."
Staff,"Male members of staff are sometimes explicit in nature, this triggers my PTSD and want to leave. B2`should only have female staff. Staff recruitment spoils what B2 does well."

Gluten free menu could be improved. 
Some bank staff very quite. "

Care received,Give lifts to and from places and could take you out and about for support. 
Care received,Whilst great support & couldn't have got through this without Claire/Rebecca/Megan(?) - there are still some underlying anxiety issues & I don't feel we have properly addressed these. It would have been good to have come up with an action plan for next steps / recommendations re: how could address these
Transition/coordination,Discharger quicker. 
Environment/ facilities,More quite and less lights. 
Staff,"Some of you are great, helpful, kind & nice but a few take sides with others & block you out and call you and just show that they don't like you.  Everyone should be treated the same."
